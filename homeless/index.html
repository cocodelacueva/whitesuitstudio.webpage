                <h2>A Stark and Lonely Reality</h2>
                <p>Winter's grip tightens on Buenos Aires. He's alone, abandoned, facing a night on the streets. No help, just the biting cold and the threat of rain. Survival demands shelter, warmth, and the promise of food come morning. This isn't a zombie apocalypse, or a ghost story. It's a stark, lonely reality. A city plunged into darkness, lit only by the moon.</p>

                <h2>Unravel the Mystery</h2>
                <p>This isn't just a survival game; it's a mystery. Why is the city empty, yet intact? Why no power, only the moon's cold glow? Where did everyone go? Who are these isolated figures, and why do they persist? What shattered humanity?</p>
                <p>You, the player, are an outsider, an amnesiac observer. The characters know the answers, the history. Your journey is to unravel their secrets, piece together the past.</p>
                <p>Each level places you in the shoes of a different character: diverse ages, skills, and backgrounds, across iconic cities like Buenos Aires, London, New York. First-person perspective obscures their faces, leaving only hands, fragments of identity. Mini-missions within each level reveal clues, fragments of the choral narrative.</p>
                <p>Learn their skills, their stories. Each danger, each choice, opens a new path, a new revelation. The city itself is a character, a familiar backdrop to an unfamiliar tragedy.</p>

                <h2>The Ultimate Goal?</h2>
                <p>To save humanity. But this isn't a linear quest. Death isn't the end. It's a thread in a larger tapestry. You'll need to understand the characters, the world, to grasp the true stakes.</p>
                <p>This is a game of discovery, not just survival. A game where the city's silence whispers secrets, and the fate of humanity rests on your ability to listen.</p>

                    <h3>Authentic Cities, Real Immersion</h3>
                    <p>'Homeless' grounds players in recognizable reality. Iconic cities – London, New York, Paris, Buenos Aires – are meticulously recreated in 3D, fostering a deep sense of place. On-site photography and research ensure authenticity. The journey begins in Buenos Aires, our home.</p>

                    <!-- <img src="icon_narrative.png" alt="Choral Narrative Icon"> -->
                    <h3>Choral Narrative, Shifting Perspectives</h3>
                    <p>Forget a single hero. 'Homeless' weaves a story through multiple characters, one per level, each with unique skills and stories. Players experience their lives, their struggles, without direct choice. Death is not failure, but a part of the grander narrative. The goal: to save humanity, a task beyond any single individual.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">

                    <h3>A World Unveiled, Piece by Piece</h3>
                    <p>'Homeless' is not a linear quest. It's a mystery revealed through fragmented perspectives. A recent, world-altering event has left its mark. Characters know the 'what,' 'when,' and 'why,' but players are outsiders, piecing together the puzzle.</p>

                    <h3>Missions as Character Studies</h3>
                    <p>Mini-missions serve dual purposes: teaching gameplay mechanics and revealing character backstories. Each mission is a fragment of a larger truth, a clue in the global mystery. You might need to sacrifice a character in one level to learn a skill that will be vital in another level, in another city.</p>

                    <p>You are not one person, but the conductor of many. You will use the information and skills learned with each character to change the world. You are the only one that can save the humanity.</p>
