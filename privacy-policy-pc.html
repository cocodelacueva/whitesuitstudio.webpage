            <h2 style="margin-top:1rem;margin-bottom:1rem;">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how White Suit Personal Card ("the Application", "we", "us", "our")
                collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our mobile application.
                We take your privacy very seriously.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2 style="margin-top:1rem;margin-bottom:1rem;">Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>
            <p>
                We want to be completely transparent:
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>
                    <strong>We Do Not Collect Personal Data:</strong> Our application is designed to be completely
                    private. We do not collect, store, or process any information that can personally identify you,
                    such as your name, email address, location, phone number, or device ID.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>No Ads or Trackers:</strong> The Application does not contain third-party advertisements or use
                    any type of tracking or analytics software (such as Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, etc.) that
                    collects information about your usage or behavior within the application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>No Usage Data:</strong> We do not track how you use the application, which features you use most,
                    or your frequency of use. Your activity within the application remains entirely on your device.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 style="margin-top:1rem;margin-bottom:1rem;">Local Data Storage (if applicable)</h2>
            <p>
                If the application saves any information (e.g., user preferences, game data, notes, etc.),
                this information is stored <strong>exclusively on your local device</strong>.
                It is not transmitted to any external servers, nor is it accessible to us.
                Upon uninstalling the application, this data will be deleted from your device.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 style="margin-top:1rem;margin-bottom:1rem;">App Permissions (if applicable)</h2>
            <p>
                White Suit Personal Card seeks minimal permissions to function.
                If the application requires any permissions (e.g., camera access, photos, notifications),
                this access is <strong>strictly for the functionality of the application on your device</strong>
                and the accessed data is never collected or sent off your device.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 style="margin-top:1rem;margin-bottom:1rem;">Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Our application does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children.
                We are not aware of the age of our users, as we do not collect personal identifiers.
                Since we do not collect any personal data, we comply with children's privacy regulations.
            </p>
