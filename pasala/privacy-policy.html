                At <strong>white suit studio</strong> your privacy is very important to us and we respect the privacy rights of every customer that interacts with our studio or with our game, Pasala! We have created the Privacy Policy below to help guide you on how we collect, store, and use any information you may provide us with. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and feel free to let us know if you have any questions.
            </p>

            <h4>
                1. Application
            </h4>
            
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how 'Pasala!' collects, uses and discloses information along with what choices you have with respect to that information. This Privacy Policy applies whenever you access Pasala! on the App, or interact with our studio or customer support team via email or our website - http://pasa.whitesuit.studio/ - henceforth collectively referred to as our Services. By using any of our Services, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access or use our Services.
            </p>
            
            <h4>
                2. What information do we collect and how/why do we use it?
            </h4>
            
            <p>
                Personally-identifiable information is information that identifies you and that may be used to contact you online or offline. Where possible we minimize any personal information collected when you use our Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                The information we do collect is used for the below purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide, update, maintain and protect our Services;</li>
                <li>To improve the play experience of our games;</li>
                <li>to respond to your comments and questions and communicate with you;</li>
                <li>for account management and other administrative matters;</li>
                <li>to prevent and investigate fraud and other misuses;</li>
                <li>and to protect our rights or our property.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                While we do not collect personal information through our game Pasala!, here is a description of how non-identifiable information is collected:
            </p>
            <p>
                In Game on Apple: When you play Pasala!, gameplay data such as preferences and progress/unlock save files are stored in your iCloud account storage to sync your game progress across devices. If you are signed in to Game Center on your Apple device, Apple will receive your gameplay activity, including scores and achievements. We do not receive or store this data on our servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further protect this information, we use a one-way hash of your device name to uniquely associate save data with your device and, if you are logged in to identify you as a player, a unique ID from Game Center. These are both stored within the filenames of your save data on your local device and, if you have iCloud syncing enabled, the filenames are also used to identify your save data within iCloud. It is important to note that we do not send this information to any external servers outside of Apple or keep a record of it anywhere outside of your local device and iCloud (if you have syncing enabled). Deleting the game from your device will remove the local copies of the save data unless you instruct the device to retain this information manually.
            </p>
            <p>
                This information is only stored on your local device, and in your iCloud account if you have iCloud enabled. By encoding this information with a one-way hash, someone cannot extract this information unless they already have it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Game on Android Devices: When you play Pasala!, gameplay data such as preferences and progress/unlock save files are stored in your local storage. We do not receive or store this data on our servers.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When contacting us directly for support, here are the ways in which we collect personal information:

            <p>
                <strong>Customer Support:</strong> We may inquire and collect basic personal information that you provide when submitting a support request in order to effectively triage the issue you are having. This includes, but is not limited to, your contact information, device type, operating system, and preferred language (called 'Device Specifications'). This information will be provided by you directly via email or our other support channels, and will only be used for the purposes of resolving the support request. This information will only be accessible by our Customer Support team on a need-to-know basis and will never be shared.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can access our customer support via email, by reaching out to us at: <a href="mailto:support@whitesuit.studio">support@whitesuit.studio</a>
            </p>
            
            <h4>
                3. Do we disclose any of your information to third parties?
            </h4>
            
            <p>
                white suit studio does not share or sell any of your personal or non-personal information with third parties unless compelled to do so by law.
            </p>
            
            <h4>
                4. How do we protect and store your information?
            </h4>
            
            <p>
                We take the storage of your information seriously and have implemented technical and administrative security measures that are designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification. We regularly review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any information that is collected is permanently deleted after no more than 180 calendar days.
            </p>
            
            <h4>
                5. How do you decline or withdraw your permission for data?
            </h4>
            
            <p>
                Deleting the game from your device will remove the local copies of the save data.

            </p>
            
            <h4>
                6. What is our policy regarding children?
            </h4>
            
            <p>
                We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to information we may collect from children using our Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not collect any personal information from children that access our game Pasala!. Any non-identifiable gameplay information we collect (detailed in section 2) qualifies as “legitimate interest” under GDPR, and is “to support internal operations of the game” under COPPA. Remote storage of any data can be prevented by removing a child account's access to iCloud through Apple's Parental Controls.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a child under the age of 13 contacts us directly for customer support, we take additional steps to protect their privacy, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Requesting their legal guardians consent for the collection of personal information from the child for the purposes of the customer support request.</li>
                <li>Limiting our collection of personal information from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to resolve the support request.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you wish to review or change the information we have about your children, you can email us at <a href="mailto:support@whitesuit.studio">support@whitesuit.studio</a>
            </p>
            
            <h4>
                7. How can you contact us?
            </h4>
            
            <p>
                If you have any questions regarding our Privacy Policy and/or practices, please feel free to contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@whitesuit.studio">support@whitesuit.studio</a>.

            <h4>
                8. What are your data subject rights?
            </h4>
            
            <p>
                As per the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) set forth in May 2018 any customer interacting with our Services has the “right to be forgotten.” At any point in time you can request access, correct or delete any personal data that has been collected and stored.</p>
            <p>
                If you have previously contacted white suit studio directly for support purposes or accessed any of our Services then you may contact us to find out more about the collection and storage of your personal information by emailing our support team at <a href="mailto:support@whitesuit.studio">support@whitesuit.studio</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                For any information stored on your local device or iCloud you can remove it by deleting the game from your device. This will remove the local copies of the save data.
