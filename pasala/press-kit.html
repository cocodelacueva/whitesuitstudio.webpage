                    Description
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pasala! is a football game where you want to score goals with as few passes as possible. Each scoring area has a target number of passes. If you go over that target, your score goes down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What the game emphasizes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strategic Passing: Planning your passes carefully.</li>
                    <li>Efficiency: Scoring with the fewest passes.</li>
                    <li>Risk Management: Balancing the desire for a good setup with the risk of penalties.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In essence, it's a game that rewards smart, precise play over excessive ball handling.

                    History
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I loved playing videogames, but I have never played them in my phone since my baby was born. She used to take long naps as a baby, but I have never been a nap-guy. As she pushed me to stay next to her, I started reading and I read a lot. However, sometimes I didn't have what to read and I also started playing videogames in my phone. In the beginning, I didn't like them. I was a strategy-videogame guy. I love playing Age Of Empires, CiV or Anno. There is no game like that for mobile. However, I have been playing for more than 7 years, and I found many games I liked. <br>
                    I wanted to create a simple and silly game. I loved the games don't need internet the most. The ones you don't need to watch ADs to play. I want players to relax for a while after a long day working. Like that small machine to play Tetris I used to owned as a child. It works only to play Tetris over and over again, but it was fun! I had to replace many batteries of that stuff and I didn't become an addict.<br>
                    I watch football matches every Saturday, and I thought I can produce a football game. I was thinking a lot about how to play football in my mobile till I thought this idea. What if do we mix chess with football?<br>
                    â€¦<br>
                    I am software developer and a frustrated script writer. I was also a film producer. Perfect combination to mix them and funded a video game studio. <strong translate="no">Pasala!</strong> is the first game produced by <em translate="no">white suit studio</em>. I am sure it won't be the last.
